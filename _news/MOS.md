I'm honoured that a piece I wrote is included in the beautiful second volume of the zine [MIND OCEAN SPACE](https://linktr.ee/mind.ocean.space). If you want to give it a read, a full pdf of the zine is available for _free_ through the provided link. My piece (on page 32!) is called "Mapping the Mountains and Valleys of the Mind" and gives a gentle introduction to my research interests. I've also formatted it as a blog post on this website, readable [here](/blog/2024/mapping/).
